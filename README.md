# poly<u>cloze</u>

A tool for studying foreign language vocabulary using cloze tests.

[Demo](https://polycloze-demo.herokuapp.com/)

## Features

**Adaptive flashcards scheduler**
:	Polycloze's flashcards scheduler adjusts the spacing between reviews based on the student's performance.
It also estimates the student's vocabulary level, so advanced learners don't have to see words they already know.

**[Digraphs](./docs/digraphs.md)**
: Even if your keyboard doesn't have all the needed keys, you can use digraphs to enter any symbol in your target language.
For example, `\a:` automatically gets turned into `Ã¤`.

**Uses SQLite**
: This makes it easy to track your vocabulary.
Even course files are stored as SQLite databases.
By default, course files are saved in `~/.local/share/polycloze` and review data are saved in `~/.local/state/polycloze`.

## Usage

```bash
# Install everything needed to build front-end.
make init

# Run server.
make run

# Open in browser.
xdg-open http://localhost:3000
```
