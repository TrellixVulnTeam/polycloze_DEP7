<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>
	Reading is a good way to acquire vocabulary, because it exposes readers to words in different contexts.
	However, it becomes a chore when you have to look up every other word in the dictionary.
	This happens <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensive_reading#Threshold">when your vocabulary is not big enough</a>.
</p>

<p>
	Our goal is to help you <b>learn words efficiently</b>, so you can start reading stuff in your target language as quickly as possible.
</p>

<h2>Strategy</h2>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p>
			<b>Prioritize useful words.</b>
			Reading is tedious when you don't know a lot of words.
			By learning the most common words first, you can quickly increase the percentage of familiar words in any text.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			<b>Use spaced repetition.</b>
			Forgetting is natural.
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">Spaced repetition</a> exploits the spacing effect to minimize the rate of forgetting.
			The less you forget, the less time you spend relearning forgotten words.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			<b>Study sentences instead of words.</b>
			It takes repeated exposures to a word to learn it.
			One exposure is rarely enough, because a word can mean different things in different contexts.
			Knowing a word is more than simply knowing its definition or translation.
			You have to know how to use the word and in what contexts.
		</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Adaptive word scheduler</h3>

<p>
	In what order should you study words?
	Strategy #1 is to study the most common words first.
	This works for beginners, but the advice might be inappropriate for more advanced learners who are using polycloze for the first time.
</p>

<p>
	The word scheduler introduces words that are appropriate for the learner's level.
	Advanced learners no longer have to go through thousands of flashcards of basic vocabulary.
	If you get all the newly introduced words at a certain <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A4ufigkeitsklasse">frequency class</a> right, then the difficulty is probably too low for you.
	The scheduler will notice and start introducing words at a more difficult frequency class.
	But if new words are too difficult, the scheduler will start introducing easier words.
</p>

<h3>Auto-tuning spacing algorithm</h3>

<p>
	There's no need to tweak the parameters of the spacing algorithm.
	The algorithm tunes itself so that the spacing between reviews is just right.
	When the spacing is too short, you end up reviewing words more than necessary.
	And when it's too long, there's a chance you'll forget the word before the next scheduled review.
</p>

<h3>Cloze deletion tests</h3>

<p>
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloze_test">Cloze tests</a> ask you to fill in missing parts of a sentence or text.
	This is perfect for strategy #3, because it tests how well you can understand the context and identify the missing word.
</p>

<h3>Digraphs</h3>

<p>
	Even if your keyboard doesn't have all the needed keys, you can use <a href="https://github.com/lggruspe/polycloze/blob/main/docs/digraphs.md">digraphs</a> to enter symbols in your target language.
	For example, <code>\a:</code> gets turned into <code>Ã¤</code>.
